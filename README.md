# AKI Mods Installer
This is a simple little application built to allow users to install zipped mods automatically via drag-and-drop. It's also a result of me trying out a new framework, which comes with some neat functionality.

## Usage
- Download the tool from the [AKI workshop]().
- Extract `AKI Mods Installer.exe` to any SPT folder (same place as `Aki.Server.exe`).
- Run `AKI Mods Installer.exe`.
- Drag and drop any compressed archives into the app (see `Supported extensions`).

## Supported extensions
- `rar`
- `zip`
- `7z`

## Features
- Theme switch (Dark, Light)
- Drop-down menu for directing to relevant modding folders
- Drag-and-drop for installing mods
